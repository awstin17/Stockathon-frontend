# Stockathon

Stockathon allows users to track stocks they care about and look up trends for new stocks they potential want to keep tabs on. All stock information is gathered using the [Alpha Vantage stock API](https://www.alphavantage.co/). 

Getting started
----------------------------------



### Installation

#### Prerequisites: 

Please install Angular-CLI by following [these instructions](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation).
Also make sure node and npm are installed. Please make sure to install at least Node  version 8.11.2 and NPM version 5.6 and Angular-cli version 6.0.8. 

Clone the remote repository

```
git clone https://github.com/awstin17/Stockathon-frontend.git
```

From within the `stockathon-frontend` directory, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Once that completes, use `ng serve` to get a local copy running
and voila! There should now be an instance of the app on:

```
http://localhost:4200/
```
Just open a web browser and copy and paste that in to view.

### Branches

The most important branch is `master` on this project. This will always be the latest released version of the app. It is also the branch whose build is hosted for you to demo [here](https://stockathon.netlify.com) on Netlify.
